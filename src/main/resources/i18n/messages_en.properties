#Footer
footer_texto = Gym Paradise is a website that aims to help its users achieve their best physical form, providing them with tools to guide them in their journey, such as calorie calculators and maximum lifting calculators, as well as a weight log to track their progress.

rm_data = "1RM (one repetition maximum, abbreviated in English) is a term used in the field of strength training and bodybuilding. It refers to the maximum weight a person can lift in a single repetition of a specific exercise. For example, if someone can lift the maximum possible weight in a single repetition while performing a bench press, that would be their 1RM for the bench press. It is also used to calculate the percentages of your strength for performing more repetitions with less weight or fewer repetitions with more weight."

tmb_data = "The BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) represents the amount of energy the body needs at rest for vital functions, being crucial for calculating the necessary daily calories. On the other hand, the BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure that evaluates the weight-to-height ratio to classify the weight status, although it does not consider fat distribution or muscle composition. Both are valuable tools in health and nutrition, but it is essential to interpret them with caution and seek professional advice for a comprehensive and personalized assessment. Based on the information from the form, we provide these values in addition to calculating your macros for your goals."

lista_data = "You can record your weight by date to track your progress and achievements."
